# Soundboard

This is a simple Soundboard project made with .NET and Windows Forms. I made it just to test my skills and may work on it later to improve it.

## Running

To run the program, simply download the `.zip` from the `releases` tab, then run `Soundboard.exe` file

## Usage

You will see a GUI that has a button named `Choose File`, a textbox with the text `Sound Name`, and a button named `Set Keybind`. To create a new keybinded sound first

1. Click on `Choose File` and find a sound file on your computer
2. Change the text in `Sound Name` to whatever you want
3. Click on `Set Keybind` and press whatever key you want the sound keybinded to

Now a box should appear with a button labeled `Play`, the name of your sound, and a button labeled whatever key you set it to. To play the sound either press `Play` or press the key you set. To change the key

1. Click on the button labeled with the current key
2. Press the new key you want
3. Now press the new key again and it should play the sound

This is basic functionality of the soundboard and more may be added in the future
